## Challenge Summary
write a function to reverse a Singly Linked List

## Challenge Description
This problem can be approached in several ways:
Iterating over the linked list and storing a reference to a current node, its previous node, and its next node.
In every iteration, after the next node is stored, the currentâ€™s node next pointer is pointed at the stored reference to the previous node.
This solution takes O(n) time and uses O(1) extra space.
A recursive solution that reverses the body of the link list before re-connecting the head.
This solution takes O(n) time and uses O(n) space on the call stack.
Creating a copy of the linked list, inserting elements at the head of the new list.
This solution takes O(n) time and uses O(n) space.

### Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Time complexity
O(n)
Space complexity

//Constant runtime 
//Big O notation: "O (1)"

//Linear runtime
//Big O notation: "O (n)"

//Exponential runtime
//Big O notation: "O (n^2)"
