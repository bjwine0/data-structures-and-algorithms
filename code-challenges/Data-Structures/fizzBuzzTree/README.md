# Code Challenge 16: FIZZ BUZZ TREE

# Challenge Summary
Implement a binary tree that evaluates a value and changes the node value to a new value given the parameters.

## Challenge Description
Feature Tasks
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
Return the tree with its new values.
