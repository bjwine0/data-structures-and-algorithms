# Code Challenge 11: Stacks and Queues

# Authors

# Challenge Summary
Implement a Queue using two Stacks.

## Challenge Description
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:

enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
The Stack instances have only push, pop, and peek methods. You should use your own Stack implementation. Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Time complexity
O(n)
Space complexity

//Constant runtime 
//Big O notation: "O (1)"

//Linear runtime
//Big O notation: "O (n)"

//Exponential runtime
//Big O notation: "O (n^2)"
