# Code Challenge 5  DSA Implementation: Linked List

# Challenge Summary
Implement a Singly Linked List Data Structure

## Challenge Description
Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

# Code Challenge 06: Linked Lists

# Singly Linked List
Linked list insertions.

## Challenge
.append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
.insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
.insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

# Code Challenge 07: Linked Lists

# Challenge Summary
k-th value from the end of a linked list.

## Challenge Description
Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the node’s value that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.
