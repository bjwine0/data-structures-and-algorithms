# Code Challenge 5  DSA Implementation: Linked List

# Challenge Summary
Implement a Singly Linked List Data Structure

## Challenge Description
Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List.

# Code Challenge 06: Linked Lists

# Singly Linked List
Linked list insertions.

## Challenge
.append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
.insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
.insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

# Code Challenge 07: Linked Lists

# Challenge Summary
k-th value from the end of a linked list.

## Challenge Description
Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the node’s value that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

# Code Challenge 8: Linked List

# Challenge Summary
Merge two linked lists

## Challenge Description
Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1). You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

# DSA Implementation: Stack and a Queue


# Challenge Summary
Implement a Stack and a Queue Data Structure

## Challenge Description
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
Define a method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
Define a method called pop that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node’s value.
Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.
Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
Define a method called enqueue which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
Define a method called dequeue that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node’s value.
Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue, without removing it from the queue.
At no time should an exception or stack trace be shown to the end user. Catch and handle any such exceptions and return a printed value or operation which cleanly represents the state and either stops execution cleanly, or provides the user with clear direction and output.
Be sure to follow your languages best practices for naming conventions.

# Code Challenge 11: Stacks and Queues

# Challenge Summary
Implement a Queue using two Stacks.

## Challenge Description
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:

enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
The Stack instances have only push, pop, and peek methods. You should use your own Stack implementation. Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.
